              I started learning web development in 2022. After a year of learning, I became proficient in React, Tailwind, and gained an understanding of backend technologies. With this knowledge, I decided to pursue freelance work.

              However, I soon realized that most clients wanted full-stack applications, complete with design and content. As someone who is very serious about meeting deadlines and trusting no one else to deliver quality work on time, I decided to expand my skills. I learned UI/UX design, Figma, Canva, WordPress basics, and content creation, so I could manage every part of the project on my own.

              While I remain a front-end developer at my core, I understood the importance of having a broader skill set. I freelanced for 2-3 clients and then became a Lead Front-End Developer at a company called Emperal Tech for 6 months. Afterward, I joined All Info Zone IT Solutions as a Lead Front-End Developer, where I continue to grow and tackle new challenges.
